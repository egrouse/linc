Linc
====
*A simple URL shortener written using Ruby on Rails*

Info
----
Linc was created as a way for me to show people how rapid and simple Rails development can be - I had the
basic working functionality of this app online within 40 minutes from starting.

It supports creation of short links, redirecting to the proper URL on visit, as well as a simple counter to
display the number of times a link has been viewed.

Installation
------------

Installation should be easy to complete;

* grab the repository contents
* run bundle install
* run rails server

Demo Site
---------
There is a demo site, hosted on Heroku, available at [this demo site](http://linc.heroku.com)
